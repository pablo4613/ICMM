Scripts completed during a fellowship at ICMM-CSIC. There I studied electronic properties of quantum materials focusing on 2D materials, graphene
multilayers and heterostructures. The aim was to understand the theoretical description of quantum
states in these systems, and propose experiments to uncover the origin of these quantum phases
and predict others. We ended un focusing on the pentalayer rhombohedral graphene structure.
